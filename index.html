      It’s finally the big day! Congrats, My Engineer! 👷‍♀️ Parang kailan lang magkaupod pa kita pag asikaso hin papel ha EVSU hasta admission, but now, finally—all the struggles, mental breakdowns, crying during removals, etc.—and here you are, finally an Engineer, not just by course but by name.<br><br>

      I’m so happy for you! You’re finally unemployed but with a degree now! Just always remember, I’ll always be here, supporting you. May you achieve everything your heart desires. Even if we may not be the endgame, I still want you to live the dream life you’ve always wanted.<br><br>

      It makes me sad that one of my dreams won’t come true—that we won’t be there at each other’s graduation. Pero okay lang, at least you got the memorable graduation your heart always wished for, because of the beautiful friendship you’ve built.<br><br>

      Keep the fire burning—go travel the world, get the job you’ve always wanted, and if you ever fall in love again, make sure it’s with a good man. I won’t hold you back anymore. I just want you to be happier than ever.<br><br>

      Go, My Engineer! You’ll always have a place in my heart. If you ever want to reach out, don’t hesitate—I’ll always be here for you. Just let me call you mine one last time, just in this message.<br><br>

      I love you always, my love. I didn’t want to send this message early because I knew you’d cry—you’re my crybaby after all. And yet you still cried, even knowing how expensive your makeup was.<br><br>

      Also, don’t think about me anymore or what I’m doing with my life—just know that I’ll figure it out. Focus on your dreams and make your life shine, just like your smile.<br><br>

      I’ll forever miss everything about you—but just having experienced you is already enough to call myself lucky. Being loved by the purest and kindest heart is like a rainbow in the sky. From the SpongeBob signing “yes” with a rainbow… to yes, I’m finally letting you go.<br><br>

      I won’t hope too much for us anymore. I’ll let God decide whatever happens.<br><br>

      Go, My Engineer! 👷‍♀️
